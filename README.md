# MY CODING PLAYGROUND

I wanted to have a place where I could play around and experiment with different coding formats.

This will be regularly updated as I create new pages with new layouts and new designs.

All pages will be vibrant and colourful as a visual representation of what the code is doing to the outcome of the web page layout.

I hope to use this repository to try new builds and layouts and keep them all in one convenient place.
